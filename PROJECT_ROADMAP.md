# Noder Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic direction and long-term vision for the Noder project, organized by development phases and milestones.

## Project Vision

Noder aims to revolutionize Unreal Engine blueprint development by leveraging AI to translate natural language descriptions into functional blueprint implementations, making game development more accessible to creators without extensive programming knowledge.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Goal:** Establish core functionality and proof of concept

- [x] Create basic UI with React and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Implement basic blueprint editor with ReactFlow
- [x] Set up Firebase for authentication and data storage
- [x] Create Gemini AI integration for blueprint generation
- [x] Implement file/folder structure for organizing blueprints
- [x] Develop landing page and user onboarding
- [ ] Create basic documentation
- [ ] Fix critical UI/UX issues

**Timeline:** Q1-Q2 2024

## Phase 2: Enhancement & Stability

**Goal:** Improve user experience and ensure reliability

- [ ] Enhance mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Optimize LLM prompts for more accurate blueprint generation
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Create user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Implement blueprint templates
- [ ] Improve UI/UX based on initial user feedback
- [ ] Add basic analytics to track user engagement

**Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2024

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

**Goal:** Add functionality that differentiates Noder from competitors

- [ ] Implement version control for blueprints
- [ ] Add collaborative editing capabilities
- [ ] Create an export system for multiple programming languages (C++, Python)
- [ ] Implement AI-powered blueprint optimization suggestions
- [ ] Add advanced customization options for blueprint visual styles
- [ ] Implement blueprint sharing and community features
- [ ] Create a plugin/extension system for custom functionality

**Timeline:** Q3-Q4 2024

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion

**Goal:** Create a broader platform for AI-powered game development

- [ ] Develop Noder marketplace for blueprint templates and assets
- [ ] Create educational content and tutorials
- [ ] Implement advanced analytics and insights for blueprint performance
- [ ] Add support for additional game engines (Unity, Godot)
- [ ] Develop direct integration with Unreal Engine editor
- [ ] Create enterprise features for team collaboration
- [ ] Implement advanced AI features for code review and optimization

**Timeline:** Q1-Q2 2025

## Phase 5: Maturity & Scale

**Goal:** Establish Noder as an industry standard for AI-assisted game development

- [ ] Implement advanced ML models trained on game-specific data
- [ ] Create industry partnerships with game studios and educational institutions
- [ ] Develop certification program for advanced users
- [ ] Implement enterprise-grade security and compliance features
- [ ] Create seamless integration with professional game development workflows
- [ ] Implement advanced community and governance systems
- [ ] Enhance scalability for large-scale production environments

**Timeline:** Q3-Q4 2025

## Key Performance Indicators

- Monthly active users
- Blueprint generation success rate
- User retention rates
- Time saved versus traditional blueprint creation
- Community engagement metrics
- Conversion rate from free to paid tiers (future monetization)

## Open Questions & Considerations

- Monetization strategy: Freemium, subscription, or usage-based pricing
- Enterprise vs. individual user focus
- Educational partnerships for academic use
- Open-source components vs. proprietary technology
- Integration with existing game development tools and workflows
- Ethical considerations for AI-generated code

## Revisiting the Roadmap

This roadmap should be reviewed and updated quarterly based on:

1. User feedback and feature requests
2. Technical advancements in AI and game development
3. Market trends and competitive landscape
4. Resource availability and development capacity
