  Removed .blueprint-background rule entirely to prevent PostCSS errors.
  Background color is applied in App.tsx.
  Grid styling is applied directly in BlueprintEditor.tsx.

  All other specific React Flow overrides removed. 
  Styling should be handled via Tailwind classes applied directly to components 
  and theme definitions in tailwind.config.js.
